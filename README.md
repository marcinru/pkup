[WIP] generating PKUP report for work

This repo is a placeholder for my future work. There will be script generating PKUP report for work in semi-automated way (`*.diff` files from logs in Git repos and Word document in `*.docx` file). PKUP stands for *Podwy≈ºszone Koszty Uzyskania Przychodu* in Polish language. Every month every employee of the company needs to generate such report. It is boring & repeatable stuff, which can be automated.
