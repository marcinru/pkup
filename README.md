pkup
====
semi-automated generating of PKUP report

PKUP stands for *Podwy≈ºszone Koszty Uzyskania Przychodu* in Polish language. Every month every employee of my current company needs to generate PKUP report. It is boring & repeatable work, which can be automated. That's why this project was created.

Requirements
------------
`Python` & `Pip` are required to use this project.

If you're on macOS and have `homebrew` installed, just type: `brew install python3`.

If you're on Ubuntu, type `sudo apt-get install python python-pip`.

Installation
------------

Assuming you have `python`, `pip` and `git` installed, run the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pwittchen/pkup.git
cd pkup
./install.sh
```

Then, edit `~/.pkup.conf` file to personalize your future reports.

Usage
-----

```shell
pkup -m "<message with description of your work>"
